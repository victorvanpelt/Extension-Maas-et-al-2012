    <ul>
        <li>
            At the start of each round, each of the two BU managers receives 10 Lira.
        </li>
        <li>
            Each BU manager's task is to decide how much of it to invest in a collaborative project with the other BU manager.
        </li>
        <li>
            Each BU manager keeps the Lira that he or she does not invested.
        </li>
        <li>
            The sum of the BU managers' individual investments (hereafter the total investment) is multiplied by 1.5 to determine the total bonus pool for the BU managers.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Supervisor decides how to divide the total bonus pool among the two BU managers. The Supervisor can choose any possible division in percentages of the total bonus pool.
        </li>
        <li>
            The total reward of a BU manager equals the remaining (uninvested) amount of Lira plus the share of the total bonus pool allocated to the BU manager by the Supervisor:
        </li>
    </ul>
        <p align="center">10 â€“ Individual Investment + amount allocated from total bonus pool</p>
