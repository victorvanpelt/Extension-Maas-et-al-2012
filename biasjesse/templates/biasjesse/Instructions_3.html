        <li>
            The Supervisor divides the bonus pool between the two BU managers.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Supervisor always observes the total investment and the bonus pool.
        </li>
        <li>
            In addition, the Supervisor can buy information about the individual investments of the BU managers.
        </li>
        <li>
            To get access to this information, the Supervisor indicates his or her willingness to pay from 0 Lira to 5 Lira.
        </li>
        <li>
            Next, the computer compares the Supervisor’s willingness to pay to a randomly determined number between 0 Lira and 5 Lira.
        </li>
        <li>
            The computer draws a new random number every round, and every number between 0 Lira and 5 Lira has an equal probability to be chosen.
        </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    If the Supervisor’s willingness to pay < the randomly determined number, he or she does not receive the information and his or her total reward is: 15 Lira.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If the Supervisor’s willingness to pay ≥ the randomly determined number, he or she receives the information and his or her total reward is: 15 Lira – randomly determined number.
                </li>
            </ul>
        <li>
            When the Supervisor’s willingness to pay is 0 Lira, he or she does not receive the information and his or her total reward is: 15 Lira.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the Supervisor’s willingness to pay is 5 Lira, he or she receives the information and his or her total reward is: 15 Lira – randomly determined number.
        </li>
        <li>
            Note that the Supervisor's total reward does not depend on the individual investments and on how he or she allocates the bonus pool.
